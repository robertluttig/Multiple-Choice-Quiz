# Multiple-Choice-Quiz
This is a timed multiple choice quiz
This was a homework assignment where we started to use Javascript. I was able to set up an event listener with a timer with the click of a button and show my first question. I wasn't able to get the the answers to show. I know I need to somehow incorporate Json stringify but couldn't do it.
